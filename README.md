# Show your style
This website is made for Hack the runway.

## Inspiration💡
I believe in the quote "Every day is your Fashion show and the world is your runway!" so that is my initial inspiration. After that, I know that some people think of themselves as a stylist and think of others' styles as quirky, in this website people can post their styles anonymously to the world, this will give them the confidence to do it in real life. So I created this motto, "So Fly with your style"


## What it does❓
The platform provides the place and space for people to share their style, sense of fashion, and swags with the public. The platform have also a like button where people can like that. Unfortunately, there is no dislike button and I believe that no one deserves a dislike for their appearance.  It's also mobile responsive and very nice looking. And people also can't delete or make changes after they make a post because I want them to feel confident about their posts and don't regret their decision.

## How I built it❓
Show your style is built using the MERN stack. I used the Atlas version of MongoDB. For the front end, I used ReactJS. This is a Web app that provides you with different posts. It gives you the platform to share and also the platform to look at others' fashion styles. 

## Challenges I ran into🎢
I have faced some challenges, one of them was setting up a domain name from the domain.com registry. I also faced some issues with the express server. Apart from that, a simple CSS card was also challenging me for a few minutes but I was able to solve that. 

## ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT I'M PROUD OF🏅🏆
As a solo hacker this week, I'm also glad that I managed my time and features to work quickly and on schedule. I'm proud of the final project I built. I learned a lot while working on the project not just technically but also in time management. I am proud I was able to complete the project and deliver a beautiful fully functional Hack this weekend.

## What I learned📚
I learned a lot this weekend. I learned some frontend designing skills and sliderjs.
How to develop fast, scalable, and simple web applications.
How to set up a nice server and fetch data to the frontend.

## Time Management⏱⌛⏳🏃‍♂️
We had a tough time managing time this weekend with our participation in this Hackathon as we had to work on multiple things altogether. Fortunately, we could do this by distributing out our work and focusing on multitasking. Extremely excited about all the teachings we got through this hack.

## Hosting👩‍🏫👩‍💻
We learned a lot about hosting while debugging for hours which still doesn't work. But I ended up learning something I wouldn't have known before. For example: how to use Heroku CLI properly to fix deployment issues.

## What's next for Show your style🔭
I believe that this web app can help improve peoples' confidence and I want to add a comment section where people can comment on the suggested post. I also want to add more features to make the users engage with the platform.
